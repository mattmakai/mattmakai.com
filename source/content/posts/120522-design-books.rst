I recently purchased and read two design books, 
`Bootstrapping Design <http://bootstrappingdesign.com/>`_ by Jarrod Drysdale 
and 
`Step by Step UI Design <http://sachagreif.com/ebook/>`_ by Sacha Greif. Both
books came out around the same time and were on the front page of Hacker News, 
so they are linked in my brain and probably many other people's minds. I felt 
I got a lot of value out of each book and for different reasons. If I
had to do it over again, I would still purchase both. 

**Bootstrapping Design**

Bootstrapping Design had a lot of specific advice for web application
designers. In particular, the chapters on typography and color were fantastic.
The typography advice on using a sans serif font for headlines and a serif
font for block text really improved my designs (which need to be incorporated
into this blog). The advice on choosing one color to start with and then
using a second color sparingly really helped get me past that initial hurdle
of uncertainty around picking color schemes.

I've read the CRAP (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity) principles
before, so I had a general understanding of how to use them in good design.
Bootstrapping Design presented specific tips on how to handle each of these
principles in practice, which is often lacking from other books.

Overall there were only two areas I could see improvement in this book. First,
incorporating a complete example (similar to how Step by Step UI Design 
is presented) at the end of the book that reinforces the tips presented.
Second, the advice and tips presented were so useful I found myself saying,
"I really want more advice like this." 


**Step by Step UI Design**

Step by Step UI Design presents a complete example from start to finish of
a web application screen design. A Photoshop PSD is included in the deluxe
package of the book (I purchased this deluxe version). I found the PSD
useful while going through the book although I'm on the fence as to whether
I would spend the extra money for it if I had to do it over again.

What I really liked about this book was that it was very practical and
focused on creating a single web application screen. The explanations
behind why certain design decisions were made opened
up the curtain as to what goes on in a designers' mind during the creation
process. As a software developer but non-design expert, the logical, 
rational look at the process greatly appealed to my analytical method of
thinking.

I found the book short enough to read in a single sitting. It is worth
several read-throughs simply because it is difficult to assimilate all the
details at once. When Step by Step UI Design is combined with Sacha's recent 
`post on the 10 hours it took to create The Toolbox <http://sachagreif.com/the-toolbox-from-idea-to-launch-in-10-hours/>`_  it provides a complete picture
of how to both come up with an idea, design it, and execute it quickly.

Overall I am very pleased I purchased both of these design books. I recommend
them to fellow software developers who want to improve their design
thinking and have a more comfortable grasp on the design process.
