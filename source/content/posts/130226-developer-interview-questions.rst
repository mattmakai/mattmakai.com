Developer Interview Questions

One of my clients was interviewing web developers and asked me about how
I go about performing technical interviews. I have interviewed 15 
developers of all experience levels for 
`Excella Consulting <http://www.excella.com/>`_ in the past year. My style
and questions are still developing. This morning when I read
`Facebook Lost A Great Engineer <https://medium.com/on-startups/4c0197625f69>`_
I felt like it might help my learning process if I synthesized my thoughts
with a blog post.

There are different interviewing philosophies so this is my opinionated 
perspective.

Open Source
-----------
Before an interview I always check out if a person has open 
source projects on `Github <https://github.com/>`_ or 
`Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/>`_. If they don't, that's a huge 
black mark to me. I do know some really great engineers who do not use Git
and do not have open source work to their name. In general though I am
very leary of anyone who does not have some sort of public project or website.
I need time to peruse their code outside that one hour interview. That process
helps me understand how someone approaches problems.


Behavioral Questions
--------------------
Once the interview begins I start by asking a mix of behavioral questions to 
determine what roles a person has performed on a team. The behavioral 
questions also help to discover what a candidate's strengths and 
weaknesses may be. For example, "Tell me a time you were developing 
software with a team." They give a bit of background then I ask simple 
followup questions. "What went right about the project?" "What could have 
been improved?" "What was the most difficult technical challenge you faced 
and how did you overcome it?" 

Simple questions of that nature to help the candidate get loosened up a 
little bit - there's no "wrong" answers because it draws on their own 
experiences. I watch out for people that pass a lot of blame around - 
"so and so didn't do their job, I had to fix everything" - even if that 
truly happened, it's a sign of team dysfunction.


Technical Questions
-------------------
That's pretty standard stuff so far. Once we get past some initial 
questions which allow me to determine if they can communicate, 
whether they work well with a team, what their general technical 
interests are, I ask some blanket, open-ended technical questions. Here 
are some examples:

* "Explain to me what happens when a user enters a URL into a browser to 
  go to a website." - web developers should understand the HTTP 
  request/response cycle, a bit about browser rendering (WebKit, Mozilla, 
  IE, etc), what happens in what order, and something about how the 
  server does the processing. This is a great question because the 
  candidate can give an overview and then go into further detail to 
  show their level of competency. They can talk about domain name 
  resolution, TCP/IP/HTTP networking stack, etc.

* "Describe the parts of your ideal web application stack. Tell me what 
  goes into your thought process in picking out which pieces to use on 
  projects." This is in line with the website I created at 
  `Full Stack Python <http://www.fullstackpython.com/>`_. If a candidate 
  can tell me about MySQL, Redis, some web frameworks and WHY they make 
  sense in some situations and not others that's good. I try to filter 
  out "well this is what I've used in the past so that's what I'm going to 
  pick." I want to work with developers that really think about why they 
  use various pieces in the stack puzzle. It also allows me to find out if
  a candidate is using interesting new tools on side projects outside their
  day job.


What I Do Not Do
----------------
I never ask "teaser" or puzzle questions like they do at Facebook.
I don't feel like puzzle questions are highly correlated enough with 
filtering out if a person is going to be a "gets stuff done" type of 
developer. Facebook and Google probably have better luck with those 
questions since it fits their culture. 

To me most puzzles are a waste of time. I would rather be solving real 
client and customer business problems by using technology. This is my 
philosophy - not judgment on the cultures where puzzle interviews 
are prevalent. If that works for them that's great. I just would not 
fit in well in that culture. It's likely that the people I want on my
development teams would feel the same way so that's the path I take.
