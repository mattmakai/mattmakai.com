Kenneth Reitz has another great post on how to 
`structure repositories for Python projects <http://kennethreitz.com/repository-structure-and-python.html>`_. Repository structure is one of those topics
that everyone seems to come up with a slightly different way of doing so
it's great to see some direction from a leader in the Python field.
