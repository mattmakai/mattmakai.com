R2-D2 or Skynet? Combining Slack Bots with the Twilio API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you've ever had the pleasure of coordinating a large team's activities 
on a project, you know scaling communication between team members quickly 
becomes a chore. What if we could build a Slack bot to automate that 
communication via Slack messages, SMS and voice calls? Come to this session 
to learn whether the bot being live coded in Python becomes our new best 
friend or a heavy handed robot overlord.
